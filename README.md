Welcome to my repository of tasks completed for my studies!  
Tasks from **7â€“10** require Node modules to be installed.

## ðŸš€ How to Install Node Modules

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the correct project folder.
3. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

That's it â€” you're ready to go! ðŸŽ‰
